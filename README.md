# noob
This is my noob project. Weeee!

Hello, I am GiGi! A tiny fish in a very big pond, but not for long!
I am transitioning my career to become a software developer. It will be a challenge, but I am ready for it.

I am currently enrolled in the Coursera Python course through Michigan University. 

My next step is Javascript, then Java, then a database platform, then Android. 

I hope to be a professional within 1 - 3 years, maybe sooner!

Wish me good tidings!
